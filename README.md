# DevBook
## DevBook Swagger is a complete, modularized and documented social network web application with swagger 2.0

## Considerations
- This web application was initially developed in the Golang [Aprenda Golang do Zero! Desenvolva uma APLICAÇÃO COMPLETA!](https://www.udemy.com/course/aprenda-golang-do-zero-desenvolva-uma-aplicacao-completa/) course offered by Udemy.
- I leave here my thanks to the teacher: [Otávio Augusto Gallego](https://www.udemy.com/course/aprenda-golang-do-zero-desenvolva-uma-aplicacao-completa/#instructor-1).
- This web application is not a copy of the above mentioned course. It has undergone some evolutions regarding some internal processes and an API documentation was added to it through the use of Swagger 2.0.
- The purpose of this code is to pass on knowledge so that other developers can learn a little about this very interesting language.

## This application is divided into two modules.
- API (CRUD, token and authentication.) 
- Webapp (Web pages, Go templates, caching and API integration.)
